title: "Enter Stage Right: HIVEMIND"
---

I've been growing slightly annoyed with the current state of image boards and _community platforms_ recently. With allegations of censorship, unresponsive admins, and other draconian practices, I felt there needed to be a better way: **And this is not it.**

HIVEMIND is just the public site for a bigger project to create uncensored communities around the web. I'll try to fight censorship as long as I can, but legal requirements may rear their ugly head, rendering my better judgment irrelevant. This is where you come in. This platform is [open source](https://github.com/samurailink3/hivemind) and licensed under a [permissive license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). If such a day comes to pass that you cannot rely on this hostname, these admins, or this place anymore to have an uncensored discussion, take the code and run.

I have a lot of ideas for what this project can become, but it'll take a great deal of work to get there. If you want to help out, join the discussion on GitHub, fork the project, mirror it, back it up. Whatever you want, just keep it going.
